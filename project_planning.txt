 -*- GENERAL STRUCTURE -*- 
Firstly is nececcery that we build a solid system of essential classes that interact with eachother 
accordly with the project specifications, this means that we need to sketch the class, test them, build methods, test them again,
support them with the porper data structure and finally, once the objects works as intended we need to test them allthogheter and
test interactions, if the interactions are not working correctly we may need to build interactive systems similarly to a how a ListIteretor
is needed to interact more efficiently with the LinkedList or the ArrayList in Java.
ex:
-Essential class system:
	Grid: a that stores the position of the ships on a matrix
	|	it need to keep a register like structure that register the entries in the object.
	|--Positional Grid: a grid that stores each player's placing of ships.
	|--Attack Grid: a grid that keeps track of where the player lanches the attacks. 
					(idea: Positional and Attack Grids of 2 different players should be linked togher.
	
	Ships: the entities that must be stored ojn the grid in order to play the game.
		Different kind of ships are just a line or a column with different lenghts.

Secondly we need to design a secondary set of class to woek on the GUI:
	The GUI should rapresent a grid where the player can select were the ship should go;
		It should also present a rapresentation of the Attack Grid so that the player can chose where to land the it,
			with maybe an "x" for a miss and a "thic" for a hit.
			It could also implement a massage system where the Attack Grid class comunicates to the player if the shot hit close to 
			a ship or not.
		It should give the player a series of drop-down menus which he can use to choose which ship to pick an drop.
		It should also have a button to pass the turn after each player actions.
